        I&apos;m a passionate Software Engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a keen eye for clean, modern UI.
        I enjoy building performant web applications that blend great design with solid engineering. Whether collaborating with teams or
        exploring personal projects, I thrive on solving real-world problems with code. Currently, I&apos;m focused on growing my skills in React,
        TypeScript, and cloud technologies while actively contributing to impactful projects.
